Questions:

1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Answers:
The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is likely a one-to-many relationship. This means that one product can belong to only one category, but a category can have multiple products associated with it. This relationship is established through the "category_id" field in the "Product" table, which references the "id" field in the "Product_Category" table.

2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Answers:
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce a foreign key constraint between the "category_id" column in the "Product" table and the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This constraint would ensure that any value entered into the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must exist as a valid "id" in the "Product_Category" table. Additionally, you can implement checks or validation rules in your application logic to prevent the insertion or updating of product records with invalid category IDs.
